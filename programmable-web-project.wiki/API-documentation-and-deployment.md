<p>Use any of the tools presented in Exercise 3 to document the API. 

For all resources you must cover:
<ul>
<li>The possible HTTP methods exposed by this resource</li>
<li>The headers in the request and responses</li>
<li>The media type utilized (in the response Content-Type header). If you are utilizing your own media-type you must describe it in the section Own media type implementation.</li>
<li>The format of the HTTP request body (just for PUT/POST), providing a clear example. If necessary, comment the example.</li>
<li>The format of the HTTP response body, providing a clear example. If necessary, comment the example.</li>
<li>The error conditions, status code and format of the error response, providing a clear example.</li>
<li><em>If you are using an hypermedia type you must provide the profile utilized, including:</em> 
<ul>
<li>Link relations. Include methods and format of the requests if they are defined in the media type. Use as much as possible IANA defined relations.</li>
<li>Semantic descriptors. If you utilize a descriptor used in some other profile (e.g. <a href="http://schema.org/docs/schemas.html">schema.org</a>) provide the link. </li>
<li>If you are extending other profiles, do not forget to link to the extended profile.</li></ul></li>

			<li>How to run the different tests to check that your environment is properly configure</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
<strong> Should be clear which is the code you have implemented yourself and which is the code that you have borrowed from other sources or created by AI.</strong>
